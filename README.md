# Music-Genre-Classification

## Introduction

Welcome to browse the music genre classification works of mine. This repository will consist a series music genre classification solutions (Published in Form of Research Paper) proposed by me. Because these solutions are inherited, I store them in this repository. The first solution is MATT, which is published in IEEE SMC'22. 

### Update Time

Generally speaking, if my paper is accepted by the conference, the code will be uploaded before the conference, and no later than one week after the conference. If my paper is accepted by the journal, the upload time will be earlier than the online time of the paper.
